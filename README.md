## Overview ##

IdentityManager is a tool for developers and/or administrators to manage the identity information for users of their applications. This includes creating users, editing user information (passwords, email, claims, etc.) and deleting users. It provides a modern replacement for the ASP.NET WebSite Administration tool that used to be built into Visual Studio.

Documentation and more information can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/IdentityManager/IdentityManager/wiki).
